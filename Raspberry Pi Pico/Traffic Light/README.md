# 🚦 Raspberry Pi Pico Traffic Light Simulation with 7-Segment Display

This project simulates a **traffic light system** using a Raspberry Pi Pico, three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green), and a **7-segment display** to show countdown timers.

It's designed and tested fully online using **Wokwi Simulator**.



## 🔗 Live Simulation (Wokwi)

You can run the simulation directly in your browser:
